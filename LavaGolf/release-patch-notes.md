* It is now possible to take screenshots while in the main menu, in the victory screen, in the power up screen and in the game over screen (alongside all levels as usual).
* Taking a screenshot will play a sound effect.
* The screenshot sound effect won't be played by error at the beginning of each level.
* Fixed a bug that on rare occasion would make the cursor disappear.
* Quitting the Help Screen while in the Video Tutorial page won't fail to restore the original music volume level.
* Solved an issue with Emergency Jump skill that would make the next shot happen faster if used while grounded.
* Rewind skill can now be used again while grounded.
* Solved a collision problem with the Golf Tee when the Rewind skill was used.
* Fixed the UI element in the Game Over scene so that it reads "Course" rather than "Level".
* Fixed a bug in the the Game UI Rewind skill button, showing it as unavailable while grounded.
* Moved around some X Spheres around the levels so they are better placed in relation to their closest objects.
* Fixed a bug that occorred after an Emergency Jump was taken while on the ground.

*Known issues*
