* (I) The screenshot sound effect won't be played by error at the beginning of each level.
* (I) Fixed a bug that on rare occasion would make the cursor disappear.
* (I) Quitting the Help Screen while in the Video Tutorial page won't fail to restore the original music volume level.
* (I) Solved an issue with Emergency Jump skill that would make the next shot happen faster if used while grounded.
* (I) Rewind skill can now be used again while grounded.
* (I) Solved a collision problem with the Golf Tee when the Rewind skill was used.
* (I) Fixed the UI element in the Game Over scene so that it reads "Course" rather than "Level".
* (I) Fixed a bug in the the Game UI Rewind skill button, showing it as unavailable while grounded.
* (I) Moved around some X Spheres around the levels so they are better placed in relation to their closest objects.
