## Lava Golf
<<Passa alla pagina in lingua italiana [qui](https://artanisx.github.io/LavaGolf/LavaGolf/italian)!>>

Welcome to the Beta page for Lava Golf! Since we're currently just opening beta for the game, we thought of having a small onboarding page only you get to see!


First of all, you can access our Itch.io page for the game [here](https://artanisx.itch.io/lava-golf). From the Itch.io page you can download the game (just put zero in the price field, and you'll download it for free).

# The Game
Dive into a new and unexpected take for golf games! In Lava Golf you do not control a golfer, instead you are the golf ball and your objective is to reach the end portal of each course without falling in the lava.
Armed by some unexpected skills for a golf ball, like the ability to dash into the air or to hit the breaks to avoid falling out of a platform, you will need to cross all the portal rings of a course to unlock its exit portal. In each course you'll also find precious experience spheres which will let you gain levels and get skill points you'll be able to use to unlock new incredible abilities and to enhance your existing ones!
Unlock unique skills, cross all the rings, and most importantly... DON'T FALL IN THE LAVA!

# The Beta
Since you decided to join the beta (thanks!), we would like to tell you how to be a good beta tester :)
Firstly, play the game as much as you like! Don't feel forced to play it, play it when you have some time and want to check it out, or want to try to beat a level where you're stuck. Or to show off to your friends!

What we need from you are, your thoughts, your feedback, which portion of the game felt great, which portion of it felt not so great and what you really didn't like! Is level 2 too bright? Are the controls unintuitive? Is level 5 far too difficult? Are the innate skills not powerful enough? Or are they way too powerful? Should the skill points unlocked for a level up be more? Less? Should some of the unlockable ability be available since the start? Is the game too bloody difficult?! These are some of the questions you should help us answer! :)

You can give your feedback in several ways:
* Tell us in person! This works if you meet up with us to try out the game!
* Send us an [email](mailto: HeiLavaGolf@protonmail.com) with your thoughts. You can write them in English or Italian.
* Follow this Google Form and fill it with your thoughts! Again, you can use English or Italian. [Not available yet] 

Remember, your feedback will help us shape the game in the right direction. It's really useful, so make sure to share it as much as you can.
