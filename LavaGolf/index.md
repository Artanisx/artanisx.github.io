## The Game
Dive into a new and unexpected take for golf games! In Lava Golf you do not control a golfer, instead you are the golf ball and your objective is to reach the end portal of each course without falling in the lava.
Armed by some unexpected skills for a golf ball, like the ability to dash into the air or to hit the breaks to avoid falling out of a platform, you will need to cross all the lava rings of a course to unlock its exit portal. In each course you'll also find precious experience spheres which will let you gain levels and get skill points you'll be able to use to unlock new incredible abilities and to enhance your existing ones!
Unlock unique skills, cross all the rings, and most importantly... DON'T FALL IN THE LAVA!

## How to play
There's an *How To Play* screen in the game itself, inclusive of a quick video tutorial we advise you to check out.
As a quick guide, please see below (keep in mind the screenshots below might not be representative of the final product).

First of all, as you may know, the goal of the game is to reach the end portal of each course. In order to activate the end portal, it is imperative the ball (so, you!) crosses ALL the Lava Rings of the level. 

![UI image](https://artanisx.github.io/LavaGolf/images/Help.jpg)

In the upper left corner of the UI, you can see the number of **Lava Rings** (the first number is the rings you already crossed, the second is the total), the number of the **X Spheres** of the level (collected / totals) and the number of **Shoots** (current / total).
Your goal is to cross ALL Lava Rings and to reach the End Portal before the last shoot is fired and you land. 
In the above example, which is from the first level, you'll be shot two times (Shoots: 0/2). After the second shoot is performed (the UI will read "Shoots: 2/2") you HAVE to reach the activated End Portal before reaching the ground or it will be Game Over. If you reach the End Portal and it's not activated (no "green" animation), it's also going to be a Game Over. Again, cross all the Lava Rings is the condition to activate the end portal.

To recap: you have a finite number of shoots to cross all Lava Rings (which activate the end portal) and you need to reach the End Portal to win the course.

You can control where the ball (so, again, you!) will go through some of your abilities. 

![Air Dash](https://artanisx.github.io/LavaGolf/images/AirDash.png)

**AIR DASH** will propel the ball in the direction the camera is facing. Face where you wish to go and then use AIR DASH to move in that direction.

![Air Brake](https://artanisx.github.io/LavaGolf/images/AirBrake.png)

**AIR BRAKE** will hit the brakes, stopping the ball while flying so you can land on a platform below you. Use this to avoid overshooting a platform, for example, or to better position yourself to AIR DASH again and maybe cross a LAVA RING or get some X SPHERES.

![Ground Dash](https://artanisx.github.io/LavaGolf/images/GroundDash.png)

**GROUND DASH** will roll the ball in the direction the camera is facing, while on ground. Face where you wish to go and the ball will roll in that direction (facing forward). Use this to avoid falling or to collect more X Spheres.

There is an important thing to note: each time you cross a *Lava Ring* the Air Dash charges are restored. Also, each time you land, both the Air Dash charges, the Air Brake charges and the Ground Dash charges are restored! So you'll be able to use them again in the next shoot.

These are the innate skills, but of course you have also other skills at your disposal: the unlockable skills. You can check them out in the How to Play screen and in the Power Up screen in game.

Speaking of power up, each time you gain 1000 experience points (gathering an X sphere nets you some experience points!) you'll gain a level. Each level gains you some Skill points; those skill points can be used to unlock skills and to enhance current ones in the Power Up Screen you'll reach each time you complete a course. Make good use of skill points as the skills and unlockable skills in particular are VERY STRONG and quite intrumental to overcome the later levels!

Lastly, have a look at a screenshot with each element of the UI and some of the game objects themselves explained:
