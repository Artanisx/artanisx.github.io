## Artanis GitHub Website

Welcome to my GitHub website. This page is fairly recent (26/07/2017) and its purpose for now is to be a repository for AHL documentation.

In the future it is more than likely I'll use this page not only for documentation of all my programming projects (using the wonderful [Sandcastle Help File Builder](https://github.com/EWSoftware/SHFB), but also in general for web pages and Wiki.


### Artanis Helper Library Documentation

AHL is a lightweight C# DLL to help the programmer with some useful and basic features like Logging and Settings handling. Since I found myself writing the same feature multiple time across different programs, I decided once is enough and thus I begun writing this library. You can access the most current Documentation via [AHLDocs](https://artanisx.github.io/AHLDocs) or directly using this link [https://artanisx.github.io/AHLDocs](https://artanisx.github.io/AHLDocs).

### Artanis Blog

I have a personal blog which can be reached [clicking here](https://artanisx.wordpress.com/) or using its regular address [https://artanisx.wordpress.com/](https://artanisx.wordpress.com/). The blog and this website are two separate entities.

### Info

Since I'm still new using Github Desktop and Github Pages (and in general Git, as up until know I've used GUI for it), I'm keeping tabs of all operations using [this page](https://github.com/Artanisx/artanisx.github.io/blob/master/notes.md).
