## Artanis GitHub Website

Welcome to my GitHub website. 

### Artanis Helper Library Documentation

AHL is a lightweight C# DLL to help the programmer with some useful and basic features like Logging and Settings handling. Since I found myself writing the same feature multiple time across different programs, I decided once is enough and thus I begun writing this library. You can access the most current Documentation via [AHLDocs](https://artanisx.github.io/AHLDocs) or directly using this link [https://artanisx.github.io/AHLDocs](https://artanisx.github.io/AHLDocs).

### Artanis Blog

I have a personal blog which can be reached [clicking here](https://artanisx.wordpress.com/) or using its regular address [https://artanisx.wordpress.com/](https://artanisx.wordpress.com/). The blog and this website are two separate entities.
