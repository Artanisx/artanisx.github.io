## Artanis GitHub Website

Welcome to my GitHub website. 

### List of Released Projects I Managed

Following [THIS LINK](https://artanisx.github.io/SPMList) you can check a comprehensive list of released videogame projects I managed in my capacity of Senior Project Manager at Keywords Studios.

### Artanis Helper Library Documentation

AHL is a lightweight C# DLL to help the programmer with some useful and basic features like Logging and Settings handling. Since I found myself writing the same feature multiple time across different programs, I decided once is enough and thus I begun writing this library. You can access the most current Documentation via [AHLDocs](https://artanisx.github.io/AHLDocs) or directly using this link [https://artanisx.github.io/AHLDocs](https://artanisx.github.io/AHLDocs).
